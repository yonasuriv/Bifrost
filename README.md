## About
Bifrost Link üîó is an application written mainly in [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) and delivered as a single executable to automate Penetration Testing Tasks.

The approach of this project is to make the work more efficient and to also be used as a training tool for various platforms such as HackTheBox, TryHackMe and other Playgrounds as well as for the preparation for various certifications related to cybersecurity. Depending on the interactions between services and source or destination of traffic, rules are created and sorted by assignment.
